# ðŸ“š Mini Library Management System

This is a backend project developed using **Spring Boot**, designed to simulate the core operations of a library â€” managing books, borrowers, and their borrowing records.

It helps demonstrate your ability to build a full-fledged REST API with proper validation, database interaction using JPA, and features like filtering, relationship mapping, and transaction management.

## ðŸ§¾ Project Overview

Imagine a small library where users (called **borrowers**) can:
- **Add new books** to the system.
- **Borrow available books.**
- **Return borrowed books.**
- **Track who borrowed which book and when.**

This system manages all of that and ensures that:
- A book canâ€™t be borrowed twice until itâ€™s returned.
- You can query for available books only.
- Borrowing history is maintained per borrower.

This is a great demonstration of **real-world backend logic** in a modular, scalable, and testable format.

## ðŸ§  What You'll Learn from This Project

âœ… **Spring Boot Fundamentals** â€“ Setting up REST endpoints, using annotations like `@RestController`, `@Service`, `@Repository`.

âœ… **JPA & Database Relations** â€“ Managing `@OneToMany`, `@ManyToOne` relationships between:
- Books and borrow records
- Borrowers and borrow records

âœ… **DTOs & Validation** â€“ Using `@Valid`, `@NotNull` for clean API input.

âœ… **Custom Business Logic** â€“ Ensuring a book canâ€™t be borrowed unless returned.

âœ… **Swagger API Docs** â€“ Automatic API documentation with OpenAPI integration.

âœ… **PostgreSQL** â€“ Real database usage instead of in-memory test DB.

âœ… **Maven** â€“ Project build, dependency management.

## ðŸ“¦ Core Entities

1. **Book**
   - `id`, `title`, `author`, `available`
   - One book can be borrowed multiple times (historically), but only one borrower at a time.

2. **Borrower**
   - `id`, `name`
   - Can borrow multiple books.

3. **BorrowRecord**
   - Links a book and a borrower with a borrow date and return status.

## ðŸ—‚ How It Works â€“ Simple Use Case

1. Admin adds a few books and registers borrowers.
2. A borrower requests to borrow a book using `/borrow`.
3. If available, the book is assigned and marked unavailable.
4. Borrower returns it via `/return`, making the book available again.
5. Borrow history can be tracked for audit or analytics.
